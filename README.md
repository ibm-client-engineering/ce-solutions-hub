## IBM Solutions Hub

The Solutions Hub documents our engineering journeys with the depth and authenticity that technical audiences deserve. We capture the complete story of how IBM solves complex business challenges using IBM Technology - from architectural decisions to implementation approaches - creating a rich technical knowledge base that demonstrates our deep expertise.

This repository hosts the front end website for the IBM Solutions Hub. It is built using a Next.js project with the Carbon Design System. The website is deployed using GitHub Pages.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

`yarn dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To make changes to the website, start by going to the `src` folder in the repository. The `app` folder holds code for each page of the website while the `components` folder holds the code for any reusable components such as the header.
